# Harness: github-tracker

This repository is designed for long-running coding-agent work. The goal is not
to maximize raw code output. The goal is to leave the repo in a state where the
next session can continue without guessing.

## Startup Workflow

Before writing code:

1. Confirm the working directory with `pwd`.
2. Read `claude-progress.md` for the latest verified state and next step.
3. Read `feature_list.json` and choose the highest-priority unfinished feature.
4. Review recent commits with `git log --oneline -5`.
5. Run `./init.sh`.
6. Confirm the frontend (`npm run dev`) and server (`npm run dev` in `server/`) both start cleanly before beginning new work.

If baseline verification is already failing, fix that first. Do not stack new
feature work on top of a broken starting state.

## Project Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16.2.2 + React 19 in repo root (`npm run dev` → port 3000)
- **Backend**: Express server in `server/` (`npm run dev` in `server/` → separate port)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Prisma (schema in `server/`)
- **Auth**: GitHub OAuth, session-based via `express-session`
- **AI**: Gemini (`@google/genai`) for repo activity summaries

## Working Rules

- Work on one feature at a time.
- Do not mark a feature complete just because code was added.
- Keep changes within the selected feature scope unless a blocker forces a narrow supporting fix.
- Do not silently change verification rules during implementation.
- Prefer durable repo artifacts over chat summaries.

## Required Artifacts

- `feature_list.json`: source of truth for feature state
- `claude-progress.md`: session log and current verified status
- `init.sh`: standard startup and verification path
- `session-handoff.md`: compact handoff for larger sessions

## Definition Of Done

A feature is done only when all of the following are true:

- the target behavior is implemented
- the required verification actually ran
- evidence is recorded in `feature_list.json` or `claude-progress.md`
- the repository remains restartable from the standard startup path

## End Of Session

Before ending a session:

1. Update `claude-progress.md`.
2. Update `feature_list.json`.
3. Record any unresolved risk or blocker.
4. Commit with a descriptive message once the work is in a safe state.
5. Leave the repo clean enough for the next session to run `./init.sh` immediately.
